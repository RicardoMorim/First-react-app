# Restaurante-Confusion
This is my app for the Front End Development with React Course!

# With this app i learned: 
 -> GIT;
 
 -> React;
 
 -> Bootstrap and Reactstrap;
 
 -> Client-Server Communication.

# Features:
This app features a home component that displays a leader, a promotion and a featured dish, and its descriptions.
There's a Menu page, where the user can see the 4 available dishes, when the user clicks in one of them, all the other dishes desappear and in the screen there are only the chosen dish, the comments of that dish and a button for the user to submit a button (its not working in vercel showoff because vercel does not allow me to write in the database).

There's also an about us page that displays the history, statistics and the description of the leaders of the restaurante.
Finally the last page is a contact page where the user can make a comment and post it in the database, as this uses a json database, and i did not find any website that hosts a json database for free.

Everything has smooth animations and small loading animations.

All pages have a header and a footer that enables the user to travel between pages.
